- name: FrameLayout
  image: ./assets/image/FrameLayout.svg
  desc: FrameLayout is a layout that allows you to place items in a given frame. It is a layout that corresponds to a level intermediate between the placement of the image directly by the designer and the layout using the algorithm.
  demos:

    target: frame3

- name: SquareLayout
  image: ./assets/image/SquareLayout.svg
  desc: SquareLayout aligns the grid with all the images in a square like a checkerboard, and the important image is displayed by enlarging the size N times. The main image can be enlarged, and then a small image can be placed to naturally show the relationship of the image.
  demos:
  - name: SquareLayout 1
    target: square
- name: PackingLayout
  desc:  PackingLayout show important images bigger without sacrificing the inherent size of the image. Rows and columns are separated so that images are dynamically placed within the horizontal and vertical space rather than arranged in an orderly fashion.
