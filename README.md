A module used to arrange card elements including content **infinitely** according to layout type. With this module, you can implement **various layouts** composed of different card elements whose sizes vary. It guarantees **performance** by maintaining the number of DOMs the module is handling under any circumstance

## Layouts
The InfiniteGrid can use various layouts.

![layout](https://github.com/naver/egjs-infinitegrid/raw/master/demo/assets/image/layout.gif)

- [GridLayout](https://naver.github.io/egjs-infinitegrid/#GridLayout): The GridLayout is a layout that stacks cards with the same width as a stack of bricks.
- [JustifiedLayout](https://naver.github.io/egjs-infinitegrid/#JustifiedLayout): JustifiedLayout is a layout that the card is filled up on the basis of a line given a size.
- [FrameLayout](https://naver.github.io/egjs-infinitegrid/#FrameLayout): FrameLayout is a layout that allows you to place cards in a given frame.
- [SquareLayout](https://naver.github.io/egjs-infinitegrid/#SquareLayout): SquareLayout is a layout that places all cards like squares on a checkerboard, and important cards are n times larger.
- [PackingLayout](https://naver.github.io/egjs-infinitegrid/#PackingLayout): The PackingLayout is a layout that shows the important cards bigger without sacrificing the weight of the cards.
